## Cyber security essentials

#### Top Technology Trend

#### intro to cyber security

Cyber security issues are becoming a day-to-day struggle for businesses.

Recent trends, side effects of a global pandemic and cyber security statistics reveal a huge increase in hacked and ***breached data*** from sources that are increasingly common in the workplace, like mobile and IoT devices. On top of this, COVID-19 has ramped up remote workforces, making inroads for cyber attacks.

> **Cyber security** is the practice of defending computers networks, electronic devices and data from malicious attacks.

The practice is used by individuals and enterprises to protect against unauthorized access to data centers and other computerized systems.

A ***strong cybersecurity strategy*** can provide a good security posture against malicious attacks designed to access, alter, delete, destroy or extort an organization’s or user’s systems and sensitive data. Cybersecurity is also instrumental in preventing attacks that aim to disable or disrupt a system’s or device’s operations.

With an increasing number of users, devices and programs in the modern enterprise, combined with the increased deluge of data — much of which is sensitive or confidential — the importance of cybersecurity continues to grow. The growing volume and sophistication of cyber attackers and attack techniques compound the problem even further.

> A cybersecurity framework is a collection of best practices that an organization should follow to manage its cybersecurity risk.

The goal of the framework is to reduce the company’s exposure to cyberattacks, and to identify the areas most at risk for data breaches and other compromising activity perpetrated by cyber criminals.

Cyber security framework works under 5 main functions:

*   **Identify :** An understanding and identification of the cyber security risks.
*   **Protect :** Measures to protect and maintain systems, assets and data.
*   **Detect :** Processes to identify the occurrence of a cyber security event.
*   **Respond :** Arrangements of detection of a possible cyber security event.
*   **Recover :** Plans and restoration procedures to reinstate services.

**How to ensure that your information is secure?** Well, Information security is based on CIA triad model. The CIA triad refers to an information security model made up of the three main components:

CIA triad

#### **Confidentiality :**

*It’s ability of system to keep your data secret and private only to you.*

#### **Integrity :**

*A system’s ability to ensure that the information is accurate and correct.*

#### **Availability :**

*This means that the information is available to authorized users when it is needed.*

> A **cybersecurity threat** refers to any possible malicious act that seeks to damage data, steal data, or disrupt digital life in general.

Cyber threats can originate from various actors, including **hacktivists, terrorist groups, criminal organizations** and **lone hackers.**

Here are some cyber security threads that will cause cyber attack :

1.  **Phishing :** An email-borne attack that involves tricking the email recipient into disclosing confidential information or downloading malware by clicking on a hyperlink in the message.
2.  **Social engineering** **:** This technique is used to deceive and manipulate victims to obtain information or gain access to their computer. This is achieved by tricking users into clicking malicious links or by physically gaining access to a computer through deception.
3.  **DDoS attacks :** DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attacks attempt to disrupt normal web traffic and take targeted websites offline by flooding systems, servers or networks with more requests than they can handle, causing them to crash.
4.  **Malware :** The term is used to describe malicious software designed to perform an attack on the device or server that downloads or runs it. Malware attacks can cause a corruption of data or even take down an entire system.

Malware is a broad term used to describe any file or program intended to harm or disrupt a computer. This includes:

*   **Viruses** **:** these infect applications attaching themselves to the initialization sequence.
*   **Worms :** they don’t attack the host, being self-contained programs that propagate across networks and computers in order to overload an server.
*   **Trojans :** it hiding inside a useful program with malicious purposes
*   **Spyware :** a type of program installed to collect information about users
*   **Ransomware :** An attack that involves encrypting data on the target system and demanding a ransom in exchange for letting the user have access to the data again. These attacks range from low-level nuisances to serious incidents like the locking down of the entire city of Atlanta’s municipal government data in 2018.

A cybercrime can cause financial and reputational damage, disrupt business and essential services, and result in further or ongoing malicious activity to an organisation. While the costs of impacts are difficult to quantify, the costs of remediation for a cybercrime or cyber security incident can be far greater than early and ongoing investment in prevention.

**Is there a way to protect yourself from a cyber attack?**

*   Update your software and operating system
*   Use anti-virus software
*   Use strong passwords
*   don’t open email from unknown email addresses
*   avoid risky clicks
*   Avoid using unsecure WiFi networks

Today due to high rate of **cyber attack**, cybersecurity is one of the biggest need of the world as **cybersecurity threats** are very dangerous to the country’s security. Not only the government but also the citizens should spread awareness among the people to always update your system and network security settings and to the use proper anti-virus so that your system and network security settings stay virus and malware-free.
