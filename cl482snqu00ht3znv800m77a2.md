> Ethics are the set of moral principles that guide a person’s behavior.

These morals are shaped by social norms, cultural practices, and religious influences. Ethics reflect beliefs about what is right, what is wrong, what is just, what is unjust, what is good, and what is bad in terms of human behavior. They serve as a compass to direct how people should behave toward each other, understand and fulfill their obligations to society, and live their lives.

here are some universal ethical principles that apply across all professions, including:

*   honesty
*   trustworthiness
*   loyalty
*   respect for others
*   adherence to the law
*   doing good and avoiding harm to others
*   accountability

> Ethics and Islam

**Islamic ethics** is a code of conduct that calls for mankind to undertake a continuous process of self-purification, in thought, feelings, and emotions; in social interactions through intentions and deeds that benefit other human beings as well as other creations of God; in using the resources that God has given him in a wise manner; and in bringing him closer to the ideal as described by the Prophet:

> **“the best amongst you are those who are the owners of the best morality.”**

The **Quran** is replete with clear messages pertaining to ethics, the standards of behavior that God expects mankind to adopt because He has sent him to this world as His vicegerent. These cover all aspects of **truthfulness, honesty, kindness, integrity, meeting commitments, and sincerity.** The best example of ethics is in the life of the **Prophet** himself.

> When Hazrat Aisha was once asked about the personality of her husband, she had replied: **“he was a reflection of the Quran itself”**.

Professional ethics provide benefits to:

*   the public
*   the clients
*   members of the profession
*   the profession as a whole
*   others dealing with the profession

> How can I apply ethics to myself?

Ethical expectations often take the form of principles such as:

*   concern for the well-being of others
*   respect for others
*   trustworthiness and honesty
*   compliance with the law
*   preventing harm to others

> Conclusion

I believe it is our **responsibility as IT professionals** to act in an ethical manner in the performance of our work duties. To inadvertently do otherwise risks losing the trust of our students, faculty, staff, communities, and the general public. Without such trust, I have difficulty imagining how IT professionals can continue to perform their duties effectively.
